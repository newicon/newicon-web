Widgets Folder
==============

These are small snippets of template that can be used to either make 
a larger template more readable or provide functionality that can be
reused in more than one page or partial. They should *not* have an 
entry in the cms_url / cms_page database tables and should not be
in subfolders if you are using them as {widgetName} as they won't be 
found. Including files in subfolders is ok.

These should only be template files.
